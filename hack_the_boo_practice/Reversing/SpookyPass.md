- The challenge consists of a single executable file
- Executing the file asks for a password to reveal the flag
- Check metadata using exiftool -> `exiftool pass` => no useful data
- Check for any unobfuscated strings in the executable using strings -> `strings pass` => reveals the password
- Execute pass and provide the password to get the flag
- Flag -> `HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_<obfuscated>}`
