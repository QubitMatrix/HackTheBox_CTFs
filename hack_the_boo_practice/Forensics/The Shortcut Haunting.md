- This challenge consists of a downloadable file which is a .lnk executable
- Check for its properties using `lnkinfo`
	- `lnkinfo trick_or_treat.lnk`
	- The command line arguments field seems to have a lot of information, on further analysing it we can notice a mention of base64 encoding
	- Copy the string after `-Command "$fko =` and input it in cyberchef -> automatically uses base64 and decodes it
	- The string after `$flag=` is the flag
	- Flag -> `HTB{tr1ck_0r_tr34t_g03s_<obfuscated>}`
